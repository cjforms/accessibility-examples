    Learn how to fix common accessibility mistakes in forms
    </h1>

<P>Series of common accessibility mistakes on forms - even when designed using the accessibility-focused <a href="https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Frontend</a> (as documented in the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a>).
  </p><p>Examples cycle through a common mistake, the same version with an explanation, then a better version and finally that better version with an explanation.</p>
