Community effort to make common accessibility issues with the GOV.UK Frontend/design system visible. An accessible frontend can still be implemented inaccessibly.

## How this works
This is set up with 'tasks' that have a:

1. inaccessible version
2. inaccessible version with explanation as to its problems
3. (more) accessible version
4. (more accessible) version with explanation as to what changes have been made and why

## Add an example

Do add an example, do these steps:

1. Forking this repository - look for the button called 'fork' at the top of the page
2. Go into the repository on your computer and install the govuk prototype kit 
3. Copy app/views/_COPY-ME folder and name it as the task you want (no spaces)
4. Make the changes that you want to show (if you want to show multiple pages in the same scenario or information after the 'continue' button ask for extra support)
5. Add the name of the changes to the title array on /layouts/bespoke.html (or admin can do this for you)
6. Push the changes back as a change request.

This is being done as a personal project so it may take a while to respond.
