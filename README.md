## An accessible frontend can be implemented inaccessibly

The GOV.UK Design system team puts a lot of effort into ensuring that the components and patterns are accessible. But there are still many ways to use those components that create accessibiity problems. 

## This accessibilty-examples tool has a series of 'tasks'
This accessibility-examples tool is set up with 'tasks' that have four versions:

1. inaccessible version
2. inaccessible version with explanation as to its problems
3. (more) accessible version
4. (more accessible) version with explanation as to what changes have been made and why

## Contribute by raising an issue
If you have comments or suggestions for changes, you can raise an issue. This is a volunteer project and we'll answer when we have time. 

## Contribute by adding a single 'task'

To add a single 'task', do these steps:

1. Fork this repository - look for the button called 'fork' at the top of the page
2. Go into the repository on your computer and install the govuk prototype kit 
3. Copy app/views/_COPY-ME folder and name it as the task you want (no spaces)
4. Make the changes that you want to show 
5. Add the name of the changes to the title array on /layouts/bespoke.html (or admin can do this for you)
6. Push the changes back as a change request.

This is being done as a personal project so it may take a while to respond.

## Contribute by changing something that is more complex

If you want to do something that is more complex than raising an issue or adding a single 'task'. please get in touch. 

## Other ways to contribute
You can add comments using the issues tab on this project or contact me (Vicky Teinaki) using various social media or, if you're on the UK government digital slack, by contacting me there.
