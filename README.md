Community effort to help designers, developers, and content designers learn about common accessibility issues with the GOV.UK Frontend/design system.

## An accessible frontend can be implemented inaccessibly

The GOV.UK Design system team puts a lot of effort into ensuring that the components and patterns are accessible. But there are still many ways to use those components that create accessibiity problems. 

## This accessibilty-examples tool has a series of 'tasks'
This accessibility-examples tool is set up with 'tasks' that have four versions:

1. inaccessible version
2. inaccessible version with explanation as to its problems
3. (more) accessible version
4. (more accessible) version with explanation as to what changes have been made and why

## Contribute by raising an issue
If you have comments or suggestions for changes, you can raise an issue. This is a volunteer project and we'll answer when we have time. 

## Contribute by adding a single 'task'
This servivce is built using the GOV.UK prototype kit. This means that if you want to contribute tasks, you will need to:
1. Install the GOV.UK prototype Kit - use the 'getting started' instructions on the GOV.UK Prototype website https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/install/getting-started  
2. Download this prototype onto your computer - use the instructions on the GOV.UK prototype kit https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/github-download-existing-prototype

Once you have the GOV.UK prototype kit installed and this prototype on your computer:

3. Copy app/views/_COPY-ME folder and name it as the task you want (no spaces)
4. Make the changes that you want to show 
5. Add the name of the changes to the title array on /layouts/bespoke.html (or admin can do this for you)
6. Go to localhost:3000 to check your changes 

If you are happy with your changes:

7. Go to Github Desktop and commit your changes with a message
8. Use the push changes button to sync your code with the Github website
9. Go to the Github website and make a pull request
10. Push the changes back as a change request.

This is being done as a personal project so it may take a while to respond.

## Contribute by changing something that is more complex

If you want to do something that is more complex than raising an issue or adding a single 'task'. please get in touch.

You can add comments using the issues tab on this project or contact me (Vicky Teinaki) using various social media or, if you're on the UK government digital slack, by contacting me there.
